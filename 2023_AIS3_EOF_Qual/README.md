# AIS3 EOF CTF

Finished one problem in the last 10 minutes and got the last place of all teams which points are greater than 0.

(Me from 2024: This is the first CTF I have ever participated in. I have no idea what I was doing then.)

The points in the archive may not be the finalized points. (But 50 points is the lowest). I also upsolved some challenges.

I finished `execgen`, `execgen-safe`, and `share` writeup.
